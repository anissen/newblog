Welcome to my brand new work-in-progress blog!

I used to have a [blog back in 2004-2007](http://andersnissen.blogspot.dk/). It has gathered a lot of dust since 2007 and now here's a new blog. What's changed? Well, a _whole_ lot of things. A lot of time has passed, a lot of new experiences and just life in general. So why _did_ I create this blog? Here's why:

## The Why

In an attempt at keeping this post short here's a TL;DR:

* I'm planning on doing a development log (devlog) on my next game. For this, I need to get into the habit of sharing my thoughts, development process and, especially, progress -- however minute.
* I've had a programming language epiphany. It's called [Haxe](http://haxe.org) and it's pretty great. I won't be forcing it down your throat but there'll be a lot of Haxe snippets strewn around in my posts.
* I'm actually quite fond of writing and haven't had any proper reason for writing, that is, outside of writing code.
* All the cool kids are doing it.

So, there it is. The general purpose of my blog. I hope to be sharing some interesting things here.
